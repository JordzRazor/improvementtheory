The Blank Canvas Theory:

The theory where you as a individual will improve your skill in something in a very intense way, and give that certain activity a break for upwards of 16 hours to 3 days to have the information processed correctly.

By doing intense training within that activity for 1 day, you increase your raw skill which is processed overnight during rest. Often or not, the raw skill built up from hours of and hours of training needs to be processed just like muscular hyper-trophy once you have finished lifting weights in the gym. You need to rest those muscles so they can rebuild themselves within your sleep after all.

After resting for 16 hours - 3 days, you will be a blank canvas due to leaving a lot of the theory from the activity behind (the possibility of making small mistakes), but with more "raw" skill than your previous canvas (the possibility of naturally being better at the game now). It's almost like being reborn, but stronger than you were last time but with not a lot of knowledge on how to control your new strength... Then you do high intensity training again after that 16 hours - 3 day break to increase your raw skill once more. To then have another 16 hours - 3 day rest again, and by repeating this process there is a small possibility (just like weight lifting), that your skill will increase far faster than if you were to being doing the same activity constantly everyday non stop. (Weight lifting reference referring to your muscles getting bigger over time.)


What makes this theory presentable? 

To be honest... Absolutely NOTHING, but if i did have to say something i would say. 

I like to think of it like having a drug for the first time. You'll be knocked right out of your socks left behind with an absolutely insane, or absolutely horrible experience, but as your body starts to get used to the drugs the effect of them will still be present but will not be so strong. Then your body/brain will start to feed off it like it's a necessary element and without it you will never be the same.  

I feel as if this runs along with game improvement too:

Community Deathmatch particularly with the FFA element and upwards of 24 people within in a server will leave you confused to how people have a positive KD of 100k to 50d while you are sitting on 50k to 100d. But the *next day* you join in to play deathmatch you'll find that you are doing a lot better with 75k to 100d. In that element you had improved massively with 25 extra kills. But the most interesting thing is, is how the improvement is only noticeable the next day rather than the same day since within the same day, your brain is still comprehending the game as it did when the day started. 

By taking these breaks in the drug example, you keep the drug/s blowing your socks off near enough every-time, granted it wouldn't be 16 hours to 3 day breaks and rather 1 week ones lol.
